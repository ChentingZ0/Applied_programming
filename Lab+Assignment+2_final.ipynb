    "\n",
    "This lab assignment must be performed in groups of 1 or 2 students (and not in larger groups). To solve this lab assignment, you are welcome to consult the lecture notes and the materials linked on the Canvas page, the Python help pages, and to try things out yourself in Python. Help from other people with the assignment (either physically, over phone, or on any forums on the internet) or chatbots, such as ChatGPT, is not allowed. This course applies the EECS honor code (https://www.kth.se/eecs/utbildning/hederskodex).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions for the labs must be submitted through the Canvas page and must be presented orally to a teaching assistant. The oral presentations will take place in the corresponding lab sessions while the course is running (see the upcoming Canvas announcement for details). After the end of the course, there will be another opportunity to submit the lab assignments and to present the solutions in June of the following year. When presenting the solutions orally, both students must be able to explain and present all parts of the assignment, including the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignments are not graded. However, if you submit your solution on Canvas until **November 16, 13:00** and the oral exam is passed in the lab session on **November 16 or 17**, you may raise the grade in Theory Assignment 2 (see the course memo for details). To submit your solution, upload this Jupyter Notebook with all programming assignments solved."
