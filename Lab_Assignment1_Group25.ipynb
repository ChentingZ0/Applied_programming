The oral presentations will take place in the corresponding lab sessions while the course is running (see the upcoming Canvas announcement for details). After the end of the course, there will be another opportunity to submit the lab assignments and to present the solutions in June of the following year. When presenting the solutions orally, both students must be able to explain and present all parts of the assignment, including the source code.\n",

    "Recall the code for insertion sort from the lecture. For your convenience we also restated it above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that in the code from the lecture, we use `L.insert` to insert an item into our list and we use `L.pop` to remove items from the list. This can be quite inefficient for the following reason. When we use `L.insert(i+1,x)` to insert `x` into position $i+1$ then each item at index $j$ with $j \\geq i+1$ must be moved to index $j+1$. In particular, this means that if we insert an item in position `0`, then we have to move all elements in the list `L` one position to the right. This takes time $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the list. The same applies to using `L.pop(i)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more classic implementation of insertion sort uses swapping of elements, because it avoids moving around so many elements in the list. Your task is now to program this more classic implementation:\n",
    "1. Implement a function `swapElementsInList(L,i,j)` which swaps the elements at position `i` and `j` in `L`. For instance, if `L=[1,2,4,5,10]` then after we call `swapElementsInList(L,0,3)`, `L` must be given by `L=[5,2,4,1,10]`.\n",
    "2. Implement the classic version of insertion sort in a function called `insertionSortSwapping(L)`. In this new function, do *not* call the function `insertItemIntoSortedList` and do not use `L.insert` or `L.pop`.<br>\n",
    "   Instead, iterate over all $i=1,\\dots,n-1$. In the $i$'th iteration, insert element `L[i]` into the correct position of the already sorted list at indices `L[0:i]`. To insert the $i$'th element, swap it to the left until it is at the right position such that all elements in `L[0:(i+1)]` are sorted after the $i$'th iteration finishes. To do the swapping, use the function `swapElementsInList(L,i,j)` to swap entries to the correct position. <br>\n",
    "*Hint:* If you want a more detailed explanation how the swapping should be done, see [Chapter 6.9](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/TheInsertionSort.html) in the book by Miller and Ranum for details.\n",
    "4. Compare the running times of the functions `insertionSortSwapping` you just implemented and `insertionSort` from the lecture. To do this, generate 5 lists with 10000 random numbers and sort them using the two insertion sort implementations. Then measure the time using `time.time()`. Compute the mean and the standard deviations of the running times of the two algorithms using the function `computeMeanAndStandardDeviation()` from the first lab session.<br>\n",
    "*Remark:* It is possible that you may find the surprising result that your implementation is slower. You can generate a single list consisting of `n` random numbers with values in `0` to `maxValue` using `listWithRandomNumbers(nSorted, maxValue)`.  Make sure that you run both algorithms on exactly the same lists, otherwise the comparison is unfair. Also, note that when you have a list `L` and you write `L1 = L` in your code, this does not copy the list. To copy the list, use `L1 = L.copy()`."
